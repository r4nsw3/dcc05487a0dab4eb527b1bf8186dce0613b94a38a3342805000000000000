  |   Semblance is a innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set     |
  |   in a beautiful minimalist world. It's a game that asks, what if you   |
  |   could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea   |
  |   of a 'platform' in a platformer and turns it on it's head. What if    |
  |   platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you     |
  |   solved problems?                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore a world where the default is soft, where the property of      |
  |   'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a   |
  |   new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat   |
  |   back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing   |
  |   the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its          |
  |   appearance.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Unique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:Can't reach a       |
  |   collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that    |
  |   the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just      |
  |   deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by.        |
  |   Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to       |
  |   solve problems.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Beautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design:Explore 3 worlds bursting       |
  |   with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming          |
  |   vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered         |
  |   score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore non-linearly:The game allows you to move between puzzles as   |
  |   you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress   |
  |   and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's            |
  |   narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and      |
  |   piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.           |
